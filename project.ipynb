    "Using multiple t-tests to compare more than two groups increases the risk of Type I error (false positives). Each t-test operates under a 5% significance threshold, meaning there is a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis for each test. When multiple t-tests are performed, these individual error rates compound, greatly increasing the overall likelihood of false positives.\n",

By doing so, it controls the overall Type I error rate, ensuring reliable statistical conclusions. If ANOVA detects significant differences, post-hoc tests (e.g., Tukey’s HSD) can be applied to identify specific group differences without inflating the error rate."
